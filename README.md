# Requirements

Given the basic Spring Boot and ReactJS applications, please implement
API automation tests to ensure the reliability of the REST service and
UI end-to-end tests for a comprehensive test coverage.


**We are looking for you to:**

* fork the repository to your own Gitlab/Github account
* Using the framework of your choosing:
  * implement API Automation tests for the Spring Boot REST service
  * implement UI End-to-End tests for the ReactJS web app
* add any applicable documentation
* include screenshots of passing tests
* note any assumptions that you make

**Please craft a solution that:**

* you would consider to be representative of your level of professionalism
* you would be comfortable handing off to someone else to maintain
* You would feel at ease delegating this to a developer who may not be as well-versed

## Palindrome problem

Given a string `n` representing an integer, return the closest integer
(not including itself), which is a palindrome. If there is a tie,
return the smaller one.

example:

Input: n = "123"

Output: "121"

## Optional Requirements

* Implement unit tests on both the API and ReactJS UI
* Note and/or implement any improvements to the code and project
  structure that you believe would make this service "enterprise
  ready"


### Very Optional 

The sample algorithm used may not be the most efficient implementation
of the solution. Implement a more performant solution and discuss or
show how you can prove your implementation is faster than the original.

# Project structure

This project includes both the Java API and ReactJS code:
* `/server` contains the Sprint Boot project
* `/client/palindrome-ui` contains the ReactJS project

# Getting Started 

- Please see [Java API details](/server/README.md)
